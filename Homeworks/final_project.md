## Data Science 101 Final Project:

Description:  The Data Science final project is intended to apply programming and analysis skills covered during the class .

#### Team size: 2-3.


#### Communications
+ Each team needs to set up  teams channel for their project4.
+ Code Should be Managed in a git repository created specifically for the project. 
+ Remote collaboration via teams will all students to work on the project together.

### Deliverables:

##### Project Proposal.  word or text document uploaded to oaks

* Generall summary of the features in the data set, size and decription of the data source
 * THREE Questions the team is proposing to answer using the data analysis, modeling and data vizualiation
 *  The proposal must include an application of either clusering, regression or classification to anwser at
 least one of the questions.
 * Description on why understanding the three questions is important and where that
 knowledge might be most applicable.
 
 
 #### Data Requirmentments:
 
Students can choose their own data set
+ Publically availible data set
+ at least 1000 rows and 5 columns
+ Ideally one data source, but no more than two data sets merged together.
+ Data should be small enough to model on a single computer (probably less than 10 million rows)
+ Data should allign with the interests of the team.
+ Data set must be proposed and approved by the instructor ( for feasibility)
 
##### Model Markdown pdf, intial draft   unloaded to OAKS.
 * Sections :
   * Description of Objectives (what are the three questions)
   * Description of Modeling Approach (what model and analysis is going to use to
   answer each of the three questions.
   * General Descriptions of the data.
   * Modeling and Analysis:
       + Code for building, and optimizing the models
       + At least three different types of plots
       + performance metrics on all models
   * Executive Summary (a paragraph of key findings)
   
##### Tableau Web Application using the model and exploring the data, Due at presentation

* At least two dashboards, with two work sheets on each dashboard
* App needs to be demo infront of class at the final presentations

##### Final Presentation Tuesday April 28, 7:30pm-10:30pm (H Block)  (Each presentation should be about 15 minutes)

Presentations will be over teams. Project teams must create a powerpoint slide descibing the questions their team were trying to answer, CRISP DM Process general proporties of the dataset, and concluesion.  Each team should end their presentation with a live demo of the Tableau web app created. 

Guidelines:

* All teams members need to participated
* Presentation should walk through the teams crisp dm process for the project
* describe the data
* explain model approach and key decisions
* explain concluesions
* demo Tableau App.



##### Subjective Participation
 * assessed a by the instructor ( 10% of final project grade)
